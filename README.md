# Utrecht Design System

The Utrecht Design System offers re-usable components for web/app layouts.

It aims to follow the [NL Design System](https://gitlab.com/nl-design-system/nl-design-system)
principles, and should eventually get merged back upstream when NL
Design System is a bit more mature.

Tested on the following versions:

* Node: 13.9
* npm: 6.13

## Getting started

Install the dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Verify that building works:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Developing components

Start the watcher that will listen for JS/CSS file changes and recompile the build
on changes:

```bash
npm start
```

Next, open `public/index.html` in your browser.

Start editing the markup in `index.html` and apply the relevant styles!
